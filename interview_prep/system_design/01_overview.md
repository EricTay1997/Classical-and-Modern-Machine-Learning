# System Design

## Software Engineering SD
- Framework
  - Understand the problem and establish scope and requirements
    - Problem:
      - Why do we want to build this feature?
      - What feature do we want to build?
    - Requirements
      - Functional
        - Identify main objects and relationships
        - Consider mutability
      - Non-functional
        - Performance (latency)
        - Availability (downtime)
        - Throughput (num users)
        - Additional restrictions (compute)
        - Security
    - Categorize needs
      - Structured or unstructured data
      - Read-heavy or write-heavy?
      - Check in on whether we want to estimate for throughput/storage requirements.
  - Propose a high-level design and get buy in
    - Data storage
    - Key microservices
  - Identify key issues and redesign 
    - Load balancing, caches, horizontal scaling, message queues
  - Recap
- Template Design

- Concepts
  - User gets the IP address of the load balancer from DNS.
  - API:
    - REST
      - HTTP verbs (GET/PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE) are performed wherever possible. Note that HTTP is just a common implementation of REST.
      - Pros: Structured way of getting information from DB
      - Cons: Requires requests for each type of entity in DB. Less space efficient as RPC.
    - Remote Procedure Call (RPC, family style)
      - Allows the execution of a procedure or command in a remote machine. You can write code that executes on another computer internally the same way you write code that runs on a current machine. 
      - Pros: More space efficient, makes development easier.
      - Cons: It can only be used for internal communication.
    - GraphQL
      - You structure the data in graphs. It enables building a request to fetch all the data you need in one call.
      - Pros: Works well for customer-facing web and mobile applications. Frontend devs can craft their own requests to get and modify information without needing backend devs to build more routes.
      - Cons: Upfront work, less friendly for external users, and not suitable when data needs to be aggregated on the backend.
  - Load balancer: evenly distributes incoming traffic among web servers.
  - Database replication
    - Usually master/slave relationship
    - A master generally only supports writes and a slave gets copies from the master and only supports reads.
    - One may have more masters for reliability, but trade off some consistency.
  - Cache
    - Cache aside pattern - check cache first, then DB if needed.
    - Write throught / write behind - App writes to cache, cache writes to DB. 
    - Tradeoffs between consistency and availability
  - Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    - A network of geographically dispersed servers used to deliver static content like images, videos, JavaScript files, etc.
    - Imo, functions as a cache
  - Stateless architecture: 
    - State data (e.g. session data) is stored in a shared data store and kept out of web servers. 
    - This is more scalable but may hinder performance in scenarios requiring frequent state retrieval.
  - Data Center
    - Each (geo-located) data center has its own servers, databases, and caches.
  - Brokers
    - Real-time transport are in-memory storage that passes data to servers, supporting asynchronous communication. 
    - This generally increases reliability too by "checkpointing". Expensive code can be held in queues while previous messages are being processed.
    - Two types
      - Pub-sub: Servers publish and subscribe to different topics.
      - Message queue: Event has an intended consumer and the message queue ensures that a message gets to the right consumer.
  - Scaling
    - Vertical
      - Adding more power to the existing machine. This is used when its more efficient to keep certain processes together, e.g. due to geographical restrictions.
    - Horizontal
      - Add more servers
      - Shard databases
        - Vertical: By feature
        - Key-based
        - Directory-based: NEed to maintain a lookup table
      - Normalization
        - Reduces redundancy but slows down joins
  - Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)
    - SQL: relational database that is composed of tables where each row reflects a data entity and each column defines specific information about the field.
      - Pros: Querying, ACID (Atomicity, Consisttency, Isolation, Durability)
      - Cons: Slower to write to (Use of B-Trees necessitates rewriting), Does not work well for mixed schema data
    - NoSQL: Nested Key-Value store, document databases, columnar databases (when search for value), graph databases. 
      - Pros: Faster writes. Managed NoSQL services come with sharding and scaling out the box.
      - Cons: Limited in the types of efficient queries that can be done. Less suitable where strong consistency is required.
  - MapReduce
    - Specifies logic to hash requests and therefore parallelize them.
  - CAP
    - Consistency: Every node has access to the same data
    - Availability: The system is always available to users
    - Partition tolerance: In the case of a fault, the system will still work
  - Web Authentication
    - Salt and hash password on signup.
    - Per session, we use session tokens for additional authentication.
  - Consistent hashing
    - Hash our nodes on a ring - allows for easy reallocation. 

## Machine Learning SD
- While ML SD questions may involve the SWE SD topics above, there seems to be a greater focus on modeling.
- Template Design (Adapted from [Pham](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Design-Interview-System/dp/B09YQWX59Z))
  - ![ml_sd.png](ml_sd.png)
  - Here, the ML Service can be a few components, e.g. both a Candidate and Ranking service for a recommendation system. 
  - The item and feature store is used as a lookup table for faster inference.
- Framework
  - Understand the problem and establish design scope
    - Why do we want to build this feature? What value would this bring?
    - Why do we need an ML solution?
    - Based on the problem, what are the specs? Num users, latency requirements (batch or online), bandwidth/throughput requirements, compute restrictions, accuracy, retraining frequency, bandwidth and scale?
  - Propose a high-level design and get buy in
  - Design deep dive (look for guidance here).
