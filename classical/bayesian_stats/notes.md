# Bayesian Statistics

## Frequentist vs Bayesian interpretation
- A frequentist perspective is that the true parameter value $\pmb{\theta}$ is fixed but unknown, while the point estimate $\hat{\pmb{\theta}}$ is a RV since it is a function of the dataset (which is seen as random).
- The Bayesian perspective is that the data is directly observed and so is not random. On the other hand, the true parameter $\pmb{\theta}$ is unknown/uncertain and thus is represented as a random variable. 
  - Ultimately, the Bayesian framework uses the **likelihood** of the data to update the **prior** distribution, obtaining the **posterior** distribution. 
  - Now, while a frequentist may address the uncertainty of $\hat{\pmb{\theta}}$ by calculating its variance, a Bayesian statistician can now reference this posterior distribution, which can of course be used to calculate variance.
